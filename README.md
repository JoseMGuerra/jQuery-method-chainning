# jQuery method chaining

## Events and effects used in this exercise

- The [.ready()](https://api.jquery.com/ready/) method offer a way to run JavaScript code as soon as the page's Document Object Model (DOM) becomes safe to manipulate.
- The [.click()](https://api.jquery.com/click/) method bind an event handler to the “click” JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
- The [.hover()](https://api.jquery.com/hover/) method bind one or two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements.
- The [.mouseenter()](https://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/) method bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element.
- The [.mouseleave()](https://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/) method bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element.
- The [.hide()](https://api.jquery.com/hide/) method hide the matched elements - the same as css "display: none".
- The [.show()](https://api.jquery.com/show/) method display the matched elements - opposite to .hide() method.
- The [.toggle( effect [, options ] [, duration ] [, complete ] )](https://api.jquery.com/toggle/) method display or hide the matched elements using custom effects.
- The [.slideToggle([, duration ] [, complete ] )](https://api.jquery.com/slidetoggle/) method display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion.
- The [.fadeTo( duration, opacity,  [, complete ] )](https://api.jquery.com/fadeto/) method adjust the opacity of the matched elements.
- The [.addClass( className [, duration ] [, easing ] [, complete ] )](https://api.jqueryui.com/addClass/) method adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements while animating all style changes.
- The [.removeClass( className [, duration ] [, easing ] [, complete ] )](https://api.jqueryui.com/removeClass/) method removes the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements while animating all style changes.
